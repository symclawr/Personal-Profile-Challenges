I was able to accomplish building a basic page for my personal profile.
I had difficulties throughout the entire process however, I believe that
the website came out decently considering that this is only my second time even using the
glitch interface. I have realized that I am pretty code illiterate and that I should sign up for
some additional coding courses during my free time so that this course is a little more understandable for me.

I was able to add a picture to the webpage that was controlled in size. I also was able to change the background color of my webpage
and also the text colors for the header and the header two. I successfully wrote a paragraph with breaks about myself and my interests.

I was able to add a second paragraph with links to my three most recent stories, bolded with bullets. 
I also was able to modify the button in the footer to link to my author page.

I had difficulity trying to link to my most recent stories. Eventually I was able to find a piece of code from the first assignment to use for this assignment.
This helped me. I continued to have difficulity however, figuring out how to change the font of my website. I was not able to figure that out. Overall,
I believe that I did a decent job considering Tumblr codes apparently do not work outside of Tumbler.
